## Introduction
This project focuses on building an emotion recognition model using ALEXNET architecture and the Adam optimizer. Emotion recognition is a valuable application in fields like user experience analysis, mental health support, and more.


## Dataset Preprocessing
The Emotic dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets. Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve model performance.

## Model Architecture
The ALEXNET architecture is defined in the notebook. It comprises several convolutional and fully connected layers, designed to extract meaningful features from images.

## Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a set number of epochs. The training process is detailed in the notebook.

## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the validation set. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to assess its performance.

## Co-Occurrence Matrix
A co-occurrence matrix is created to analyze the relationships between predicted and true emotions. It provides insights into the model's performance across different emotion categories.

## Image Prediction
The trained model is used to predict emotions in sample images. The notebook showcases the predictions along with confidence scores.

Feel free to explore the notebook for a comprehensive understanding of the entire process.
